The challenge was to **manage any kind of resource**; we decided to focus on **blood donations**. Requestors sign up with **vital information**, and potential donors undergo **real-life medical assessments** to determine eligibility.

The platform enables **anonymous connections** between donors and recipients by sharing minimal information, ensuring a **streamlined and secure** process.

The final product was part of a **comprehensive concept** that involved setting up a **network of hospitals and blood banks**, making the entire process **safer and regulated**.
