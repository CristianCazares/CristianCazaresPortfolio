**Mexico's Food Bank Network (BAMX)**, wanted to innovate by having a **mobile app** to improve one of their processes.

Our team created a space where external contributors can **create their own campaigns** without depending on BAMX's infrastructure. This empowers the general public to:

- Find the collection centers closest to you, or look for the ones that the communities you belong to are doing.

- Improve donations management by having everything you need in one place to keep track of donors, stock and received merchandise.

- Set clear objectives and take advantage of communities to encourage donations.
