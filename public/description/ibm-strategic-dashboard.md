A Web App built for **IBM** to **analyze** and **visualize** their employees' courses, badges, and certifications.

It implements **AI algorithms** and **data analysis tools** to extract insights from both the **internal data of IBM** and **external** information from **mainstream online courses platforms**.

The design is focused to be **organic** to IBM's product by implementing their design system and **clear charts**.

During the development, I was the **leader of the frontend team**, while also making **contributions to the API and data analysis service**.
